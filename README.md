Sample: bluelist-android-base
===

The bluelist-android-base sample is the base version of BlueList, a simple grocery list application.  In bluelist-android-base, the items do not persist to a mobile backend. If you want to persist items to a mobile backend, use the bluelist-android-mobiledata sample.

This sample works with the Mobile Backend Starter, an application boilerplate that is available on [Codename: Bluemix](https://www.ng.bluemix.net).  With this boilerplate, you can quickly incorporate pre-built, managed, and scalable cloud services into your mobile applications without relying on IT involvement. You can focus on building your mobile applications rather than the complexities of managing the back end infrastructure.
