Sample: bluelist-base
===

The bluelist-base samples (Android and iOS) are the base versions of BlueList, a simple grocery list application.  Using the bluelist-base samples, the items do not persist to a mobile backend. If you want to persist items to a mobile backend, use the bluelist-mobiledata samples.

These samples work with the Mobile Cloud, an application boilerplate that is available on [IBM Bluemix](https://www.ng.bluemix.net).  With this boilerplate, you can quickly incorporate pre-built, managed, and scalable cloud services into your mobile applications without relying on IT involvement. You can focus on building your mobile applications rather than the complexities of managing the back end infrastructure.
