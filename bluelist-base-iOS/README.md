Sample: bluelist-base-iOS
===

The bluelist-base-iOS sample is the base version of BlueList, a simple grocery list application.  In bluelist-base-iOS, the items do not persist to a mobile backend. If you want to persist items to a mobile backend, use the bluelist-mobiledata-iOS sample.

This sample works with the Mobile Cloud, an application boilerplate that is available on [Codename: Bluemix](https://www.ng.bluemix.net).  With this boilerplate, you can quickly incorporate pre-built, managed, and scalable cloud services into your mobile applications without relying on IT involvement. You can focus on building your mobile applications rather than the complexities of managing the backend infrastructure.
